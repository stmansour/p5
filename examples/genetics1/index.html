                <p >The purpose of this code is to use concepts from genetics and natural
                    selection to solve problems that might otherwise by unsolvable in a
                    practical sense. One example, the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a>
                    states that an infinite number of monkeys hitting keys on a typewriter for an infinite
                    amount of time would eventually type any textual work you can think of, like the complete works
                    of William Shakespear. My favorite variation came from Mr. Burns in
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loMEF18Ir4s">this clip from The Simpsons</a>.
                    While that is true, the probability of that happening is so low that it is irrelevant.
                    Consider the problem of randomly getting to our target phrase:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are 95 possible characters available for the text (upper and lower case,
                        punctuation, special characters).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are 40 characters in the target phrase.
                    </li>
                    <li>The probability of randomly selecting all the right characters to match
                        the target phrase is 1 in 95<sup>40</sup>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The chances are roughly 1.285 x 10<sup>79</sup>,
                    which is incomprehensible. But to break it down further, if we set up a parallel processing
                    solution which could randomly produce and check 1 billion random 40
                    character phrases every second,
                    it would take around 4.07 x 10<sup>62</sup> years to get to the target phrase. Even if we
                    reduced the possible character set to 26 letters and a space, it would still take
                    5.69 x 10<sup>40</sup> years, still incomprehensibly long. The earth
                    has only existed for about 4.3 x 10<sup>9</sup> years.
                </p>
                <p>The algorithm used here simulates natural selection found in life on earth... in the
                    following way -- the natural selection process favors those text phrases that resemble
                    our target phrase. Each successive generation is the result of a breeding process
                    that is more successful the closer parents' are to the target phrase. The parents each
                    supply half the "DNA" to their child, and the child has random mutations.  The result
                    is very effective at selecting generations that move toward the target phrase. The
                    solution for a 40-character frame usually happens in less than 4000 generations.
