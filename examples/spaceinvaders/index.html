                    One evening, when I should have been recording,
                    I had a sudden nostalgic urge to play the
                    old computer game
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a>.
                    I had a version of this game on my
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore PET</a>
                    (from my college days, which was pretty cool back in 1977).
                    But I do not have one for my Mac, and on a whim I decided to
                    try to code a version of the game for a browser so it could
                    be easily shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may seem simplistic, but this game was pretty
                    revolutionary when it came out.
                    The aliens were modeled after octopi, squids and crabs! It was
                    the first game to save high scores. Its music interacted with
                    the on-screen animation to influence the player. As you destroyed
                    invaders they would speed up in their movements, and the music
                    sped up along with it. This would fluster many players :-)

                    Here are some good reference videos on YouTube to see what
                    the game actually looked like and sounded like back in 1978
                    and 1979:

                        This image was very helpful for creating the images. I
                        found it on Google Images.
